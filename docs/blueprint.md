# **App Name**: LinguaLens

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Enable users to upload images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WebP) via drag-and-drop or file input button for OCR processing.
- Multi-Language OCR: Allow users to select one or more languages (English, Amharic, Oromifa, Tigregna, or a combination) present in the uploaded image and use that to increase OCR extraction quality. Incorporate a tool that analyzes the image to determine which language to focus on when more than one language is possible.
- Editable Text Display: Display the extracted text in a resizable, editable text area with undo/redo functionality.
- Text Download: Provide options to download the edited text as plain text (.txt) or a document format (.docx).
- Multi-Session Management: Allow users to create and manage multiple independent OCR sessions, switching between them via a tabbed interface.
- Copy to Clipboard: Add a "Copy to Clipboard" button to quickly copy the extracted text.
- Dynamic Language Switching: Provide a prominent and easily accessible mechanism (e.g., a dropdown menu in the header/settings) for users to change the display language of the UI at any time (English, Amharic, Oromifa, Tigregna).
